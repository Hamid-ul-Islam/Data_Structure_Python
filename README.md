## Introduction

Understanding and implementing data structures is crucial for building efficient and scalable software solutions. This repository is created to support your learning journey by offering a hands-on approach to various data structures in the Python programming language.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a specific data structure. Here is the current folder structure:

- [BinaryTree](BinaryTree/)
- [Graph](Graph/)
- [HashTable](HashTable/)
- [LinkedList](LinkedList/)
- [Stack](Stack/)
- [Queue](Queue/)
- [Heap](Heap/)

Each folder contains the implementation of the respective data structure. You can find the Python files within each folder, and the file paths are structured as follows:

- `BinaryTree`: [BinarySearchTree.py](BinaryTree/BinarySearchTree.py)
- `Graph`: [Graph.py](Graph/Graph.py)
- `HashTable`: [HashTable.py](HashTable/HashTable.py)
- `LinkedList`: [LinkedList.py](LinkedList/LinkedList.py)
- `Stack`: [Stack.py](Stack/Stack.py)
- `Queue`: [Queue.py](Queue/Queue.py)
- `Heap`: [Heap.py](Heap/Heap.py)

The detailed explanations and comments within each Python file facilitate easy comprehension.
